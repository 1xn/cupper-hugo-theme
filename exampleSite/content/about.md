Not much at the moment to say. This is just a starting point to write my own personal journal.

This website is built with Hugo. A static site generator written in the Go language. The site is deployed through GitHub and Netlify. 

It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper 

You can learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio).
